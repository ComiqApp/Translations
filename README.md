## Translations for Comiq
This repository contains translations submitted by the community for Comiq. Its purpose is to make Comiq multi-lingual and provide comfort for people from all regions of the world to enjoy, together.

### Submitting your translations
Translations can be submitted by editing strings in each language's respective file. For instance, to translate the string showing `User profile` to Arabic, you would replace `'navbar_uMenu_UserProfile' => 'User profile',` in `arabic.php` to `'navbar_uMenu_UserProfile' => 'الملف الشخصي للمستخدم',`.

Some strings are purposely left in English as they are what we call `CSS values`. An instance of this is `'sponsored_align' => 'left',`. For most languages, this should be `left` as we want the text to come from left to right but in some languages such as Arabic, the text is aligned to the right.

_**Please only modify strings that are in English and start with an asterisk (*) or improve an already existing string.**_
